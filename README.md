Experimental pieces of software, mostly in C++

Inside each folder you'll find a different piece of software usually develop to train someting or learn something new related to c++ development.

## lineparser

Contains a super simple program called readfile that is able to read the contens of a file, line by line and check for some matching symblos. In this exemple, I'm checking for pairs of parantheses and curly brackets. These two symbols should always be used in pairs inside the text.txt, that means that they need to be balanced. For example, you cannot close a parentheses if you didn't open it before.

Things I'm using inside this code:
- Vector
- Map
- Stack
